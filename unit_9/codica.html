		<p>Caduceus of mercury, has been used as a symbol for medicine and healing for centuries. Healthcare professionals often used this symbol in their logos, letterheads and signage. This familiar visual cue of the two serpents coiled around a staff was used as a starting point for the design exploration. Then by turning it sideways, it began to represent process, movement and flow. The logo was further simplified to give it a more contemporary and modern expression.</p>
