		<p>Problem<p>
		<p>As an agency of record for AT&T, Interbrand was asked to explore new ideas for the brand that would give it a more contemporary look & feel, starting with their newly acquired fleet of natural-gas powered Chevy vans.</p>
		</aside>

		<article id="right">
		<p>Solution<p>
		<p>The AT&T logo with it's ubiquitous globe and stripes, was used as a starting point for design explorations. By enlarging and overlaying the stripes with colored bands, a new visual pattern was created. This was then applied to the vans with a two-tiered system, where a standard pattern would be used for corporate vans and a more flexible pattern style could be used for U-verse vans that would feature premium content.</p>
